-> # A High-Level Journey Through Kubernetes <-

-> *From Containers to Cloud-Native* <-

---

# 1. Introduction to Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes?

* More than just "container orchestration"
* Comprehensive platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management 
* Infrastructure for multi-container applications
* Scheduling, scaling, and health management

---

## The Origin Story

* Born from Google's internal system called **Borg**
* Represents 15+ years of Google's production experience
* Open-sourced in 2014
* Now one of the largest open source communities

---

## The Container Revolution

Docker popularized containers, but enterprises needed more:

* Service discovery and load balancing
* Storage orchestration
* Automated rollouts and rollbacks
* Self-healing capabilities
* Secret and configuration management

---

## Real-World Impact

Kubernetes powers mission-critical workloads across industries:

* **Media**: Netflix (streaming content)
* **Finance**: Major banks (trading platforms)
* **Retail**: Target, Shopify (e-commerce)
* **Transportation**: Uber, Lyft (ride-sharing)

---

# 2. The Pre-Kubernetes Era

## Evolution of Cloud Infrastructure

---

## From Physical to Virtual

* Server virtualization revolution
* Abstraction of physical hardware into VMs
* More efficient resource utilization
* Birth of cloud computing and IaaS

---

## The Container Breakthrough

* Docker democratized containers in 2013
* Simple, open platform for developers
* Build, ship, and run distributed applications
* Lightweight, consistent environments
* Rapid deployment and iteration

---

## The Orchestration Problem

* Managing complex systems at scale
* Challenges with deployment, networking, scaling
* Maintaining containerized applications
* Need for automation and orchestration

---

## Google's Secret Weapon

* **Borg** and **Omega** - internal systems
* Managed vast container fleets across data centers
* Efficient resource allocation
* Scheduling and fault tolerance expertise
* Principles shared through Kubernetes

---

# 3. Birth of Kubernetes (2014)

---

## The Strategic Decision

* Google open-sourced Kubernetes to:
  * Set industry standards
  * Promote ecosystem around container orchestration
  * Advance cloud-native adoption

---

## Design Principles

* Built for a multi-cloud world from day one
* Cloud-agnostic approach
* Portability across environments
* Comprehensive scalability and reliability

---

# 4. Early Adoption and Community Growth (2015-2017)

---

## Kubernetes 1.0 and CNCF Formation

* Production-ready release in July 2015
* Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) established
* Vendor-neutral home for the project
* Community-driven innovation and collaboration

---

## The Ecosystem Explosion

* Major tech companies adopt and contribute:
  * Red Hat, IBM, Microsoft
* Kubernetes-focused startups emerge
* New PaaS business models
* Growth in user groups and meetups

---

## Technical Milestones

* **Deployments**: Simplified application updates
* **StatefulSets**: Management of stateful applications
* **RBAC**: Enhanced security and resource management

---

## Early Adopters

* Organizations that migrated early
* Motivations and implementation journeys
* Challenges and solutions
* Improvements in scalability, reliability, efficiency

---

# 5. Enterprise Maturation (2018-2020)

---

## From Experimentation to Production

* Shift to production workflows
* Enterprise endorsement
* Stability and utility in real-world applications

---

## The Managed Kubernetes Era

* **GKE**: Google Kubernetes Engine
* **EKS**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
* **AKS**: Azure Kubernetes Service

Handling operational complexity for broader adoption

---

## Critical Ecosystem Projects

* **Helm**: Package manager
* **Istio**: Service mesh
* **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting
* **Operator Framework**: Managing Kubernetes Native applications

---

## Student Demo

* Deploy a k8s cluster to Google (GKE)
* Deploy an LLM (or two)
* Deploy Open WebUI
